- estimated cumulative distribution functions of the system times for three different
  categories of successfully transplanted patients
- model-based and empirically estimated results for the blood-type-specific models
- LP patients who ultimately get transplanted in the LP queue wait much longer 
  (measured in months) than individuals who are transplanted as HP patients 
  (measured in days)
- compare the empirical waiting times of HP patients with the results of our model 
  for patients who arrived directly to the HP queue and for LP arrivals that 
  subsequently self-promoted to the HP queue
